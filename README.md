# 🎧 Deezer RPC | v0.0.1  

**Deezer RPC** is a simple and lightweight Python application that updates your Discord Rich Presence with the song you're currently playing on **Deezer**. It detects the active **Deezer window** and syncs the track title in real time.  

It has been done because I found no way to make [Yuuto's project](https://github.com/JustYuuto/deezer-discord-rpc) work even though it had the feature to display the name of song & artist as window title.
